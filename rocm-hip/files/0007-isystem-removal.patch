Description: -isystem breaks proper order of C and C++ include paths
 The addition of |-isystem "$HIP_CLANG_INCLUDE_PATH/.."| to HIPCXXFLAGS and
 HIPCFLAGS needs to be removed from hipcc [1]. Once HIP is installed in /usr,
 hipcc ends up passing -isystem /usr/include, which breakes the proper order of
 C and C++ include paths. If I understand correctly, it's unnecessary for hipcc
 to pass these flags anyway. A patch to remove them will eventually be made
 upstream.
